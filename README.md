# Code Quiz

The Code Quiz application allows users to take a short, multiple choice, five question quiz within a time of two minutes. If they answer a question correctly, they gain five points. If they answer a question incorrectly, they do not gain points and are docked ten seconds. When the quiz is over, the user will be presented with their score and prompted for their initials. They will then see a Highscores board that they can clear or continue to add to by starting over and trying again.
